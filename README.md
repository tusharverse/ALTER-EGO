## 🧠 About The Project

**AlterEgo** is an AI-powered web application that enables users to create and interact with different AI personas.

Unlike generic chatbots, AlterEgo focuses on **personality-driven conversations**, allowing users to simulate different behaviors, tones, and identities.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🤖 AI Persona-based Chat System
* 🎭 Custom Personality Configuration
* ⚡ Real-time Response Handling
* 🔌 OpenRouter LLM Integration
* 📱 Fully Responsive UI
* 💾 Local Storage-based session persistence

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (React + Vite)
        ↓
Browser (API Call)
        ↓
OpenRouter API
        ↓
LLM Response
```

⚠️ Current Design:

* Direct API calls from frontend
* No backend layer

🚨 Limitation:

* API keys are exposed in the browser

---

## 🔐 Security Consideration

This project is currently **frontend-only**, which means:

* API key is stored in localStorage
* Not suitable for production-level deployment

### ✅ Recommended Fix

```
Frontend → Backend → OpenRouter API
```

This ensures:

* 🔒 API key protection
* 🛡️ Rate limiting
* 📊 Better control
